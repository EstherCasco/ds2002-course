# Labs

Labs are exercises that you will submit as your own work. They will be released on Canvas on a regular weekly cycle, typically opening on Wednesdays and closing seven days later.

## Submitting Labs

Labs will be released under "Assignments" on Canvas. The Canvas assignment will provide a link with specific instructions. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gists</a> are special Git repositories and a great way to share code snippets like your lab submissions.

To submit your work, follow these instructions:

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a new secret Gist</a>. If you're not familiar with Gist, don't worry. We will go through the process for Lab 1 during class together. 
3. Generally speaking you can work with this Gist like a Git repository but see notes below.
4. Save your work in the Gist:
    - **Option A (easiest):** In the Gist on GitHub, add/edit your files needed to complete the lab. 
5. Copy and Paste the Gist URL to the Lab assignment in Canvas and submit for grading. You can submit multiple times until the assignment closes on its due date. So pay attention to that.
