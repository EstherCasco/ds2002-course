# Getting started with Environments

The goal of this activity is to familiarize you with GitHub Codespaces and your development environment. You'll learn how to start and manage Codespaces instances and understand the basic workflow for completing labs and exercises.

> **Note:** Go to your ***forked course repository*** and start Codespaces as described in the [course's general setup instructions](../../setup/README.md). If you haven't forked the repo yet, do it now.
